       * As seen here, making a get request in angular is quite simple. There are different ways of achieving the same thing here but this is my proffered way of doing it. Since $http.get returns a promise. We can assign it to a variable and use the 'then' method in order to proccess the data when it arrives. 'then' is passed 2 functions and arguments. The first one handles a successful request and the second handles unsuccessful requests. The request object is return from the promise. I have assigned it to 'res' throughout this application.
       * @param $scope.searchterm is bound to the input element used for search in the html so there is no need to query the element for the value.
